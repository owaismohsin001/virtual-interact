										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Advantages of Call Center Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Operating an in-house call center involves significant upfront investment plus relentless ongoing fixed &amp; variable costs.  Internal call center operations also place intense demands on human resources, require complex technology, and can distract from focusing on your core business.  Therefore, an increasing number of companies are realizing that keeping these operations in-house are not always the best decision.   Businesses that partner with an outsourcing call center to handle their customer support, sales or back office operations might experience some major advantages of outsourcing.</p>
<p>Call center agencies provide services to clients around the world in a variety of industries. Some of those outsourcing services include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.realinteract.com/">Customer Support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.realinteract.com/">Technical Support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.realinteract.com/">Sales</a><br />
<h6>1. <strong>Focus on core competencies</strong> –</h6>
<p>Outsourcing your call center operations will put a difficult &amp; disruptive business function in the capable hands of a professional agency.  Therefore, allowing you to focus on your core business.</p>
<h6>2. <strong>Provide 24/7/365 customer support</strong> –</h6>
<p>Providing 24/7 customer support is usually very difficult (and expensive) to manage internally.  However, professional call center agencies typically operate 24/7 already. Therefore, hiring a call center partner will allow you to quickly and easily offer 24/7 coverage and keep your customer happy!</p>
<h6>3. <strong>Limit Technology Investment</strong> –</h6>
<p>Why make massive investments in technology to manage your internal call center operation when there are call center agencies that have already made the investment?  Outsourcing is a great way to use technology more efficiently and stay on the cutting edge!</p>
<h6>4. <strong>Benefit from proven processes</strong> –</h6>
<p>Professional agencies really are the “Call Center Experts”.   Why reinvent the wheel, when agencies bring proven processes and experienced management to work for you almost instantly.</p>
<p>The advantages of outsourcing are no longer just about cutting costs and saving money.  It is about increasing efficiency of internal employees, getting to the market faster than your competitors, maximizing workforce flexibility, and gaining access to highly qualified employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Business is Booming? Time to Outsource!</h2>
<p>When business is booming and call volume is increasing, you may find that dedicating more call center agents to handling customer contact has an adverse effect on your fulfillment or production operations. Although the phone ringing is often a positive sign, high call volume that is mishandled can often bring growth to a screeching halt.  When that happens and you begin looking for ways to manage the volume, outsourcing to a proven call center agency may be a viable solution. Here are some basic items to consider when outsourcing in boom times:</p>
<h6><strong>Call Center Outsourcing 101</strong></h6>
<p>The basic idea behind <a title="\&quot;Call" href="https://www.realinteract.com/">call center outsourcing</a> is that your company contracts with another company to take calls on your behalf. Instead of all those calls reaching your office, the call center answers instead.</p>
<p>There are a few different terms used for companies that provide communication outsourcing services, including call centers, contact centers, and answering services.</p>
<h6><strong>Not Very Difficult…</strong></h6>
<p>Handing off your calls to a call center is far easier than you think. Our Call center partners will work with you to design a custom call center plan that mirrors your internal operation, supports a specific process, or supplements a portion of your business.</p>
<p>The way our call center agents answer the phone is a good example of this customization. If you greet callers with “Thank you for calling Top Notch Manufacturing Company, how may I help you?”, then we would have our agents answer in the same fashion.</p>
<h6><strong>Overflow Call Handling Capabilities</strong></h6>
<p>The above examples illustrate the core objective of any call center outsourcing relationship.  This is to implement a solution that functions as an extension of your business.</p>
<p>After our agencies create your account and call handling workflow, all you have to do to launch the application is forward your phone lines.  Call center agents will be available when needed so calls can be forwarded on-demand, 24 hours a day.  Overflow call handling will allow us to start taking calls automatically whenever you’re busy.</p>
<p>Just like that, you have freed up time to refocus your resources without sacrificing customer service or losing potential business. You can finally relax and reap the benefits of having an overflow call center.</p>
<p>If you are ready to start your outsourcing journey,  <a title="\&quot;Contact" href="https://www.realinteract.com/">contact us</a> today or call at 678-882-5737</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips for Spring Data Cleansing…</h2>
<p>The long hard winter is finally over! It’s starting to feel like spring – the sun is shining, the temperatures are warming, and companies everywhere are cleansing their customer data!</p>
<h6><strong>1. Clear out duplicates</strong></h6>
<p>Duplicate records decrease efficiency and increase customer annoyance exponentially. Save your agents time that would be otherwise spent on compiling information between several database records by sorting your records by name and combining any duplicated user information.  You can greatly enhance customer experience and cut costs by preventing customers from having to repeat information each time they interact with customer support.</p>
<h6><strong>2. Keep it relevant</strong></h6>
<p>Is your database full of extraneous information? Though having enough information is necessary, gathering too much can overload your agents and database – not to mention discourage your customers from filling out forms or contacting your support representatives!</p>
<p>Take a long, hard look at the information you gather about your customers. Is it all necessary? What purpose does each piece of data serve? If you can’t answer these questions, it’s time to eliminate the data.</p>
<h6><strong>3. Research, research, research</strong></h6>
<p>There’s no way to get around this aspect of data cleansing. Someone (or many someones) must dedicate time to researching each record to ensure accuracy and completion. This can be accomplished through many techniques, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>calling customers (by internal staff or outsourced call center)</li>
<li>data verification emails</li>
<li>verifying information when customers interact with the contact center</li>
<li>verification direct mailings</li>
<li>hiring an outside company to verify information</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which single technique or combination that your company will employ, be sure to evaluate the labor spent after each cleansing to ensure that it was the most efficient and effective solution for your company.</p>
<p>From time to time, every company will need to repeating the data cleansing process. However, not all subsequent rounds of cleansing will not be as intensive as the first.   As you repeat the process, you’ll begin to find the most efficient methods for your company.</p>
<p>Real interact Call Centers can help address your database issues and outsource the data cleansing to top agencies around the world!  If you are ready to explore the power of outsourcing, please <a title="\&quot;Contact" href="https://www.realinteract.com/">contact us</a> or call 678-882-5737</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>n the dynamic realm of politics, effective communication plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and driving electoral success. In fact, political call center outsourcing has emerged as a popular strategy for parties and candidates seeking to connect with voters through get out the vote (GOTV), political fundraising, and voter survey applications. While using political call center agencies offers several advantages, it also raises concerns related to privacy, transparency, and the integrity of democratic processes. This article essentially reviews the pros and cons of outsourcing to political call centers and provides a comprehensive overview of its impact on modern political campaigns.</p>
<h4>The Advantages:</h4>
<p>Cost-Effectiveness: Many campaigns often face budget constraints, making political outsourcing an appealing option. For certain types of work, offshore centers in countries with lower labor costs can provide substantial savings while maintaining service quality.</p>
<h4>The Concerns:</h4>
<p>1. Data Privacy: Handing sensitive voter data to external entities raises concerns about data privacy and security breaches. Thus, ensuring strict data protection measures and compliance with relevant laws is essential.</p>
<p>2. Accountability and Transparency: Outsourcing can lead to a loss of control over the communication process. This can potentially lead to inconsistent messaging or inaccurate information dissemination. Therefore, maintaining oversight and transparency is crucial.</p>
<p>3. Cultural Sensitivity: Language barriers, varying cultural norms, and political contexts can pose challenges for call center agents. Unfortunately, this can possibly result in misinterpretations or unintended consequences.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Political call center outsourcing can significantly enhance a campaign’s outreach capabilities. Furthermore, call center agencies can help to streamline voter engagement and data management. However, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits and concerns associated with this practice. By adhering to ethical standards, maintaining transparency, and prioritizing data privacy, political campaigns can leverage outsourcing while safeguarding the integrity of the democratic process. As technology and political landscapes evolve, the conversation around this practice will undoubtedly continue. This will warrant ongoing scrutiny and adaptation to ensure responsible use in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips for Better Email Support</h2>
<p>Think email is “Old School”? Think again.  Social, text, live chat and advanced self-service are creating a lot of buzz in contact centers these days, but now is not the time to forget email. It’s time to make it better.  Many customers still prefer to email customer support. Phone remains number one, but ignoring email as a <a title="\&quot;Customer" href="https://www.realinteract.com/">customer support</a> channel could be a major mistake. In fact, Forrester research indicates email is still the third most widely used form of communication among online adults.</p>
<p>Email can meet the new world of customer expectations as long as contact centers are willing to keep an open mind and take a can-do approach. Here are three tips to creating better email customer support:</p>
<h3><strong>Ramp Up The Speed</strong></h3>
<p>We live in an age of instant gratification. Customers want help and they want it now. So how can the contact center deliver? Following are some ways to improve your email response time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hire more people</li>
<li>Improve your email software</li>
<li>Route emails<br />
<h3><strong>Promote Self-Service Options</strong></h3>
<p>Our call center clients often ask, “how do I encourage my customers to use self-service?” Email offers the perfect opportunity to do this without seeming to push your customer off to another channel. Gently point customers in the right direction by suggesting they visit your website to do specific tasks or include links to your online knowledge base or self-service portal in the agent email signature.</p>
<p>And speaking of the email signature—make sure it includes the name and location of the agent. Again, customers want to know they’re speaking with a human who can effectively solve their problem.</p>
<p>If you are ready to consider email customer support, contact us today at 678-882-5737 to discuss your situation and explore the email support outsourcing options available.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="&quot;h-consulting-call-center-broker&quot;" class="wp-block-heading">Consulting | Call Center Broker</h2>
<p>Hiring a call center broker can help you find the best possible call center agency while minimizing risks and maximizing the odds of success. A consultant can provide great outsourcing advice and help locate a service provider that meets your specific needs and expectations. Another advantage of using a outsourcing broker is ongoing support and added negotiating power with the agency during the contracting phase and any potential issues in the long term.</p>
<p>That being said, none of these benefits will materialize if you go with the wrong broker. Here are some tips to find a qualified call center consultant who’s right for your company:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call Center Knowledge:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Never choose a generic service broker who tries to be all things to all people. Instead select a professional that specifically knows about call centers and can provide specific outsourcing advice. With a little practice, most anyone can spout the right jargon, but the proof comes from actually understanding the meaning behind what they’re saying. Do they just talk a good game or can they walk the talk?</p>
<p>In addition to call center knowledge, a quality broker must keep up with trends. Technology, labor, &amp; global markets are constantly changing. Make sure your call center broker is on top of the latest developments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Happy Clients:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While the above items are all critical, the proof comes from satisfied clients. Having happy clients demonstrates the broker can combine their call center knowledge, experience, and track record to produce tangible results that matter most. Any successful broker will have many happy clients. Confidentiality is important but a great broker should be able to share many success stories.</p>
<p>When selecting an outsourcing broker, don’t just grab the first one you find. Instead perform a bit of due diligence to find a broker with call center knowledge, industry experience, a record of accomplishment, and happy clients. When they possess all four of these characteristics, they will also possess the ability to help you outsource successfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how advanced technology becomes, it will never be a proper substitute for human-to-human connections.  That is especially true for high-stakes customer interactions.  Automation is wonderful when we need to schedule an appointment or make a payment.  However, there is nothing like a real human agent when disputing a hospital bill, filing an insurance claim or committing to a purchase agreement.</p>
<h5><strong>Misuse of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h5>
<p>Unfortunately, some call centers are repeating errors made with early chatbots.  They are viewing the current generation of AI applications as viable replacements for human agents.  Needless to say, this is causing a power struggle between people and machines.</p>
<h5><strong>Helping Agents Improve, Without Replacing Them</strong></h5>
<p>Technology really does affect the way human beings work.  Automation of key contact center processes in recent years has streamlined workflow.  However, it hasn’t improved agents’ ability to satisfy customers once they’re connected.  That is essentially because they’re still handling direct customer engagement and also processing and interpreting the data needed to resolve customer problems.</p>
<h5><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong><strong> Complements Human Intelligence</strong></h5>
<p>We all want our <a href="https://www.realinteract.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer service</a> experiences to be quicker and more efficient.  AI customer support can help make it so without losing our primal need for compassion at high-stakes moments.  We recognize the reassurance in a firm handshake, a steady gaze and the cadence of a confident voice.  Artificial intelligence may get there one day.  However,  until it does, we should focus on leveraging its enormous potential to complement human intelligence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Warning: Below Market Call Center Rates</h2>
<p>An International call center agency proposes a rate that is several dollars below every other agency in that country. Sounds great, right??  Not necessarily!  Here are the reasons to stay away from any agency that presents a below market call center rate:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h6><strong>Loss Leader</strong></h6>
<p>Some newer International call centers will provide new clients with a <a href="https://www.worldwidecallcenters.com/call-center-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price</a> which is completely unprofitable. They get the client to commit to them and cut ties with their internal center or other outsourcing partner (thinking they got a great deal). Then, a few months later, this cheap call center comes back with some reason why the price needs to be increased $2-$3/hour. This practice is quite unethical and harmful to the client.</li>
<li>
<h6><strong>Filling a hole</strong></h6>
<p>Some call centers will often provide a low price to clients that can quickly “fill a hole” that is left by a former client that terminated their agreement. First of all, you should be cautious about any call center that is put into this position. Secondly, you will likely see the call center come back and raise the price as soon as they recover from the lost client.</li>
<li>
<h6><strong>Nickel &amp; Dime</strong></h6>
<p>Most professional call centers charge standard rates that are essentially “all-inclusive”.  Therefore, the agency typically has little or no fees for telco, reporting, programming, etc. Desperate international call centers will occasionally provide a VERY low hourly rate to win your business.  However, they often have intentions of charging a variety of fees for every extra service they provide. Make sure that every fee is spelled out in advance by your agency.</li>
<li>
<h6><strong>Rarely Successful</strong></h6>
<p>Most importantly, below market contracts are almost never successful in the long term.  Find a good Call Center, pay them a fair rate, and enjoy the power of outsourcing.</p>
