Many agents believe that it is less risky to lose a customer than make a decision that appears to be detrimental to the company.\u00a0 After all, they think, \u201cNo one ever got fired for enforcing a policy, rule or procedure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0<strong>They are afraid they will be penalized and have to pay for a mistake<\/strong>. For example, if they upgrade a person from a room to a suite, they will have to pay the difference.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0<strong>They are afraid of negative feedback.\u00a0<\/strong>There is often very little upside for an employee who makes empowered decisions. Awards and celebrations are rarely offered to employees simply because they made an independent decision to satisfy a customer.\u00a0 There is, however, downside when an employee is criticized for ignoring policy or subjecting the business to undesired costs.<\/p>\n<h5>3 Steps to Success<\/h5>\n<p>In order to overcome this culture of fear, businesses need to implement three steps for boosting employee empowerment:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0<strong>Assure every department and manager is on board<\/strong>. They must enforce a culture of empowerment within their teams, and they must stand by support agents when they\u00a0<em>do<\/em>\u00a0\u201ccolor outside the lines\u201d.\u00a0 It just takes one piece of negative management feedback for the employee grapevine to get the message that the policy is just lip service or the policy du jour.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0<strong>Empowerment Training<\/strong>. You have to teach them what is it, how to actualize it and how the organization celebrates it.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0<strong>Reinforce and celebrate empowerment<\/strong>. Most empowered decisions have no significant cost.\u00a0 For example, it might include waiving a late fee or bending the rules on a cutoff time.\u00a0 Empowered employees can modify policies and procedures to fit a situation\u2026and keep customers happy.<\/p>\n<p>The irony is that companies spend massive amounts of money on marketing to\u00a0<em>attract\u00a0<\/em>customers but skimp when it comes to keeping them.\u00a0 If budget were devoted to customer retention by training employees to make empowered decisions, they would see a far more immediate, measurable return on their investments.\u00a0 By empowering employees, you will have happier customers. You will increase market share. And you will make more money.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Empowering Your Customer Support Agents Employee empowerment in customer support is defined as allowing phone agents to make fast decisions on the spot in favor of the customer.\u00a0\u00a0It is critically important for organizations to give\u00a0customer support agents\u00a0the power to make &hellip; <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogger-more-holder\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/customer-support\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":7568,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[24],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8442"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8442"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8442\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8443,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8442\/revisions\/8443"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7568"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8442"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8442"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8442"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
