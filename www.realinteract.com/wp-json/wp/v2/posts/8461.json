Time is limited and they can often take their business elsewhere in a heartbeat. The stakes are high for winning new customers, retaining them, and ensuring that they are happy and willing to spread the word about your services.\u00a0 Succeeding in the marketplace requires monitoring customer feedback throughout their entire journey with your business. Following are four keys that can provide the building blocks for improving your customer satisfaction:<\/p>\n<h6><strong>1) \u00a0Customer Contact Monitoring:<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>There are a variety of channels through which a customer can contact an organization.\u00a0 Some customers call into a contact center while others prefer self-service through a website or mobile app.\u00a0 The later might then lead to an online chat, an email request, or a call for support. It is common for a customer to use multiple channels to solve a particular need. Best practices requires that your company provides consistent information regardless of the channel.\u00a0 For instance, a customer might start on the Web to do some research before making a decision to purchase via a different channel.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2)\u00a0Social Media Monitoring:<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Organizations can\u2019t ignore Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or other social networks. Listening to and responding on social media is an opportunity to understand the customer voice on a different level. The content shared on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_media\">social media<\/a>\u00a0is less predictable and certainly less controllable than other customer feedback mechanisms, as it can go viral quickly. Social media is an increasingly important \u201cvoice\u201d of customers, and requires a plan for both monitoring and responding.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>3) Customer Feedback:<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>For consumers, it is routine to receive a request for feedback subsequent to a transaction.\u00a0 Those responses are extremely valuable whether it\u2019s an airline flight, an online purchase, a call for support, or even just a Web site visit.\u00a0 Customers are providing a snapshot of their satisfaction and\/or willingness to promote you to others at that given point in time.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>4) Market Research:<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>There is unlimited news and independent third-party perspectives regarding the customer experience for any given industry. Every organization needs to monitor its brand reputation to understand how consumers perceive their business. Companies should examine their own brand perception and that of their competitors to update their customer service model and reflect what\u2019s working best within a particular industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Four Keys To Improve Customer Satisfaction Many customers are becoming more demanding in terms of quality and interaction speed.
