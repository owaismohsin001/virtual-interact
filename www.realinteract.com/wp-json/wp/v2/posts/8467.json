They get the client to commit to them and cut ties with their internal center or other outsourcing partner (thinking they got a great deal). Then, a few months later, this cheap call center comes back with some reason why the price needs to be increased $2-$3\/hour. This practice is quite unethical and harmful to the client.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h6><strong>Filling a hole<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Some call centers will often provide a low price to clients that can quickly \u201cfill a hole\u201d that is left by a former client that terminated their agreement. First of all, you should be cautious about any call center that is put into this position. Secondly, you will likely see the call center come back and raise the price as soon as they recover from the lost client.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h6><strong>Nickel &amp; Dime<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Most professional call centers charge standard rates that are essentially \u201call-inclusive\u201d. \u00a0Therefore, the agency typically has little or no fees for telco, reporting, programming, etc. Desperate international call centers will occasionally provide a VERY low hourly rate to win your business. \u00a0However, they often have intentions of charging a variety of fees for every extra service they provide. Make sure that every fee is spelled out in advance by your agency.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h6><strong>Rarely Successful<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Most importantly, below market contracts are almost never successful in the long term. \u00a0Find a good Call Center, pay them a fair rate, and enjoy the power of outsourcing.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h6>If you are ready to get started, please contact us today at 678-882-5737<\/h6>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Warning: Below Market Call Center Rates An International\u00a0call center agency proposes a rate that is several dollars below every other agency in that country.
