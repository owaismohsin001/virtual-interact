A dysfunctional culture in your call center almost ensures that your employees will be looking for the door with your customer experience suffering in the process. Your newest employees often have the best perspective and can give you some honest insight on the positives and\/or negatives of your culture. Now ask your customers and they might tell you a lot about the culture based on their interactions with customer support.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there is always hope\u2014and many times the call center is the best place to start improving your company culture. What\u2019s the trick? We all know those excellent\u00a0<a title=\"\\&quot;Customer\" href=\"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/\">customer service<\/a>\u00a0skills that help you make new sales and save customers. Point a few of those inward toward your colleagues and watch your company culture shift. Here are some quick tips to turn around your culture and your CX:<\/p>\n<h6><strong>1. Lead with empathy\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013<\/h6>\n<p>We love the word empathy and for good reason. It\u2019s all about truly caring about the feelings of another person. This is a key to sales and to good relationships with your friends and family. But are you empathizing with your employees and colleagues? This is the first step to changing your culture and building a team that can translate this to your customers.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2. Watch your mouth\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013<\/h6>\n<p>Gossip is a fantastic culture killer. It\u2019s so easy in customer service to get in this mode of customer bashing. Talking poorly about customers affects your attitude toward those customers. In the same way, talking poorly about other employees has that same effect.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>3. Can do spirit\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013<\/h6>\n<p>Nothing is more deflating to a customer than when they call customer service for help only to hear a \u201cNo. Sorry, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d In the exact same way, employees hate hearing this same line internally. When an employee comes to you with a problem, adopt a\u00a0<em>buck stops here mentality\u00a0<\/em>and take responsibility for the solution. Then, they get to go back to the customer with a solution rather than a sad face.<\/p>\n<p>If you are ready to enhance your customer experience, contact Worldwide Call Centers today at 678-882-5737 for free call center\u00a0\u00a0cervices. \u00a0We will discuss your situation and explore.<\/p>\n<p>1635 Old 41 Hwy, NW<br \/>\nSuite 112-312<br \/>\nKennesaw, GA 30152<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Great Culture = Great Customer Experience Corporate culture is often difficult to understand and even harder to control.
