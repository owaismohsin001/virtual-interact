They grow your revenues, bring repeat business and spread the good word about your brand. A great customer experience goes a long way in making customers happy. One of the best ways to track the performance of your\u00a0<a title=\"\\&quot;Technical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/\">support team<\/a> and and provide a great customer experience is to know your \\\u201dnumbers\\\u201d \u2013 like Call Volume, Response Time, Abandon Rates, Call Resolution, &amp; First Contact Resolution. This gives you honest, trackable data and helps provide a clear understanding of the overall satisfaction of your customers. Here are some Customer Support Metrics you must monitor regularly:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Call Volume<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s important to monitor the daily volume of calls and inquiries into your support team. It helps you find out if there is any rush of support traffic at certain times of the day. This will tell you when you should allocate most employees &amp; resources to customer service. Although your business has working hours, your customers may run on a different schedule. They\u2019ll try to reach you as soon as they face an issue. You can note the most frequently called times and prepare for it, even if they\u2019re outside your business hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Response Time<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nDo you like waiting for a response when you are facing an issue? Response Time is the amount of time taken for your business to respond to a customer issue. It is one of the most important metric that affects customer satisfaction. If you keep the customer waiting, you are likely to bring down customer satisfaction considerably. Studies show that 54% of customers feel 3 minutes to be a reasonable response time while waiting for a customer support agent over the phone. Customers also believe that 24 hours is reasonable to get response by email.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. First contact resolution<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nFirst contact resolution tells you how many issues were resolved during the initial engagement. Greater this number, the better it is. To maximize this metric, you have to find out which issues are escalated beyond the first contact, on which channels and why. So you need to break out this metric by various channels and type of customer issues. It helps you identify the reasons for escalation and resolve them quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Measuring the performance of your customer service enables you to rapidly improve it. It allows you to easily identify the key pain points of your customers, areas which need additional resources and support agents that can benefit from additional training. You can even streamline support by automating frequent responses and creating Knowledge Base or FAQs. This helps you improve your product or service, boost customer experience and grow your business faster.<\/p>\n<p>Call Centers can help to address these metrics and outsource your operations to the BEST Agencies around the world!
