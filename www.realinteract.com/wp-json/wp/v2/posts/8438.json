Sales \u2013 Meet Marketing<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Buyers are more demanding than ever.\u00a0 They expect you to be knowledgeable about their situation and the challenges they face and offer consistent, focused messaging.\u00a0 To do that effectively, sales and marketing need to be unified.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, sales people are spending too much of their time not selling.\u00a0 According to Forbes, about two thirds of the average sales person\u2019s time is spent on non revenue-generating activities.\u00a0 Many of those precious hours are taken up creating sales content, or conducting research on clients or sectors that would be better conducted elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>And by \u2018elsewhere\u2019, we mean marketing. Sales and marketing need to work more closely together than ever, to make sure that, as a business, you\u2019re delivering consistent, focused messages that filter into every piece of collateral and every customer conversation.\u00a0 When marketing insights constantly feed into your sales strategy, you\u2019ll be giving customers more of what they want: tailored, relevant information.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2.) Forget Cold \u2013 Go Warm<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>The death of cold calling is a hot topic.\u00a0 But while having too many leads is every sale manager\\\u2019s dream, in most cases, this isn\u2019t the reality and a properly equipped strategic outbound sales function is a necessity.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, the most progressive organizations don\u2019t rely solely on cold calling in a post-pandemic world \u2013 they do warm calling instead.\u00a0 How do you raise the temperature of your prospects as part of your outbound strategy?\u00a0 It\u2019s a combination of information and efficiency.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2.) Training Needs to Stick<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Training sales staff to be more knowledgeable, confident and empathic is great, but at the moment largely ineffective. According to Xerox research, sales professionals lose 87% of training insights in just a month.\u00a0 How do you make sure sales training is absorbed and implemented?\u00a0 We suggest using gamification, video and peer learning. Get your teams together regularly \u2013 via Microsoft Teams or Zoom if necessary \u2013 to share best practice and success stories.<\/p>\n<p>And best of all, create a training journey. Give your agents a training goal, and a series of short, easy-to-absorb steps to achieve it.\u00a0 Let them track progress towards that goal and take regular tests and revision sessions.\u00a0 Repetition is the key to learning, but it should be fun, practice-based and easily applicable to day-to-day activities.\u00a0 In a nutshell, make it easy for agents to turn training into action and action into habit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Post-Pandemic Call Center Sales Trends As the economy opens up, consumers and businesses are starting to spend again.\u00a0 While some have suffered real financial hardship over the past year, others have built up a pool of post-pandemic cash.\u00a0 In order &hellip; <\/p>\n<div class=\"blogger-more-holder\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/call-center-sales-trends-for-the-great-comeback\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":7778,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[163],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8438"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8438"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8438\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8439,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8438\/revisions\/8439"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7778"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8438"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8438"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.virtualinteract.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8438"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
