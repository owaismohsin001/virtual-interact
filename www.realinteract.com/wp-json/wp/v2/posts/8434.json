Here are a few practical tips to help your company stay productive and scale your customer support call centers, without making your customers feeling like they\u2019re working with a robot:<\/p>\n<h6><strong>1<\/strong>.\u00a0<strong>Boost Productivity Through Collaboration<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014<\/h6>\n<p>Small inefficiencies add up quickly and drain your resources. Saving agent time and improving collaboration boosts productivity without turning them into robots. For this reason, allowing employees to utilize cloud-based collaboration tools like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\">Slack<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a>\u00a0is a great idea!<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2. Balance Live vs. Automated<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014<\/h6>\n<p>Striking a balance between a personalized customer experience and responding to customer requests in a timely manner, can be difficult. So how do you ensure a good experience for your customer without taking too long to respond? Utilize features that maximize efficiency of your live operators to give your customer the best experience possible. Consider setting up time-based escalations or action-based alerts, and writing pre-configured templates for frequent responses. Little things like these allow agents to respond faster and be inserted at the most crucial times, so you can maintain a personal touch when it counts.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>3. Help your customers help themselves<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014<\/h6>\n<p>A well-designed Help Center \u2013 or an all in one knowledge base, community, and customer portal \u2014 deflects issues and appeals to the 67% of consumers that would prefer to use self-service rather than contact support. When your customers can find their own answers quickly and easily, everybody wins.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>4. Leverage Multichannel Customer Support<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014<\/h6>\n<p>The modern customer demands an effortless experience. \u00a0Which means they want to be able to connect with you when and where it\u2019s convenient for them. \u00a0Accordingly, that might be via phone, via Twitter, over email, or even within your corporate application. \u00a0Innovative companies need to build a multi-channel support foundation that allows you to tie these contact points together. \u00a0 Consequently, this will make it manageable for your team and allow for adding new methods, as necessary. \u00a0Consider solutions that can expand to include traditional phone, email or live chat support alongside social media, self-service and embedded mobile offerings.<\/p>\n<p>f you are ready to scale or improve your Multichannel Customer Support, contact <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realinteract.com\/\">realinteract.com<\/a> today at 678-882-5737 to discuss your situation. \u00a0Our consultants will discuss the Customer Support Call Centers available from the 1635 Old 41 Hwy, NW<br \/>\nSuite 112-312<br \/>\nKennesaw, GA 30152<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While many companies are already focused on multichannel customer support, they often struggle to balance productivity, scaling, and maintaining a great customer experience.
